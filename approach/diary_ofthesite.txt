10 july {
    i started around 1 am, i was able to finish the home page, this included the nav bar, landing, and the footer
    i am begining to grap the css framework called bootstrap. it is actually easy, i tried downloading node js, but it didnt 
    work.

    probable task for tomorrow or later in the day.
    i would work on a toggle that shows the packages type and i want to create the three packages pages and their 
    products cards. i pray God helps me.

    still 10th july i was able to design the template for the three packages remaining the table diagram which i would do shortly
    
    i was able to design the table for account sizes and prices
}

11 July{
    i started with the card design or should i say the responsive design of the tables and i finished 
    which was very beautiful

    replicated the design in the swift and evaluation page, ill try to work on the login and dash board connect 
    all the links and begin to implement the php side of the website

    this would require me to design the login and the signup options again.

    also i would try to fix the sass and css file dependencies and start using my theme color
