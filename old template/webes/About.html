        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared
        when you visit or make a purchase from UpChartFunding (the “Site” and the “Company”)
        PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
        When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
        information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are
        installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the
        individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to
        the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
        automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”<br><br>
        We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
        – “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an
        anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies,
        visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.<br>
        – “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address,
        browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.

        processed by third party providers (PayPal, Stripe, World Remit, etc.) and we do not maintain a
        copy of that information within our systems.<br><br>
