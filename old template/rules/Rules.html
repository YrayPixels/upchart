        <p style="left">Get access to live funded accounts by trading our systematic swift account, where you are tested and progressively carry out trading on the new synthetic platform. 
        In this account type you are not restricted by minimum or maximum trading days, the more you make profit the more you earn, but you must observe the daily loss and drawdown rules.
        To Qualify for a live funded account of your chosen capital size, you have to make up to 10% of your capital size, this is however done systematically and it is accumulated at every payout you request, up to 3.5% of your account size is deducted from your profit and  added to make the total 10% needed to qualify for a funded account.
        For example you have a 10,000$ account and you make 1000$ for the first month and request for payout, you'd be paid 12% of your profit that's 120$ and 3.5% of 10,000$ which is 350$ is deducted from 1000$ to make up part of your funded account, 
        If you make a profit of 1000$ and receive three payouts, it will amount to 350 multiplied by 3, which would be 1050$ which will be up to 10% of the account size of 10,000$.
        There are no restrictions to your style of trading, but proper lot size and good risk management must be adhered to, appropriate stop loss also should be added.
